# Algorithms and Data Structure

## Description
This project is a personal initiative to implement algorithms described in Thomas Cormen's book *"Introduction to Algorithms"*. The main goal of the project is to deepen my understanding of how various algorithms work, their structure, and their performance. The project is not intended to provide practical utility for a wide audience but is created purely for my own enjoyment and learning.

## Progress: Implemented Algorithms
Here is a list of algorithms I have already studied and implemented (the list will be updated as I progress):

### Sorting Algorithms

- [x] [Merge Sort](/sort/mergeSort/README.md)
- [x] [Selection Sort](/sort/selectionSort/README.md)
- [ ] Quick Sort
- [ ] Timsort
- [ ] Heap Sort
